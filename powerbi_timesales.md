## Times Sales Data - Interactive PowerBI Report

**Project description:** This PowerBI project was created using the sample data set 'Plant_DTS.xlsx' and aims to provide a finished report capable of providing high value insights into the example companies' KPIs. The data set includes product types, country, revenues, cost of goods sold, and quantity sold.

### 1. Transforming Data in Power Query

The first step in creating our report is to perform any necessary transformations in our data within Power Query. During this step we look at handling missing data, errors, recoding variables, reformating data types when necessary, and delete any unneeded columns.
